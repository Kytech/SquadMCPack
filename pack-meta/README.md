# SquadMCPack Packwiz Pack-meta

This folder does not contain a usable minecraft instance by itself. To obtain one, run the build script
after cloning [this project's repository](https://github.com/Kytech/SquadMCPack) or download from the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Kytech/SquadMCPack/releases).

Files in this folder should not be edited by hand. These files are managed by the build script to enable the packwiz
auto-update/installation features.
