# Packwiz Pack-meta

If you are seeing this page after entering the packwiz url for this pack in your web browser, you were probably trying
to access the [project repository](https://github.com/Kytech/SquadMCPack) page or pull down this pack using the
[packwiz installer](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap).

# Using this Folder in the Repository

This folder does not contain a usable minecraft instance by itself. To obtain one, run the build script
after cloning [this project's repository](https://github.com/Kytech/SquadMCPack) or download from the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Kytech/SquadMCPack/releases).

Files in this folder should not be edited by hand. These files are managed by the build script.
