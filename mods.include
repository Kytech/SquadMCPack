# This file contains a list of mods to add to the base pack.
# Each mod to be added is specified on its own line and can be given as a curseforge
# URL, Mod ID, or name, though specifying a name may result in prompts if the name cannot
# resolve exactly, preventing unattended builds.
#
# A URL to the mod's curseforge page installs the latest for the MC version.
# A URL to a specific version download will install that specific version.
#
# The order you specify the mods in is the order they will be installed. If a mod has dependencies
# that are not yet installed, you will be prompted for them. To avoid the prompt and allow unattended builds,
# Add the dependecy mods before the mod(s) that require that dependency.
#
# After editing this file, run the build script as follows: (the -u parameter is optional
# if no .exclude file was also edited)
#
# build/buildPack.sh
