The Patch files compare existing files in the modpack only. Need to check and see what files are uniquely new
and added by Shawn. Manually add those in.

Will need to manually compare mod list. Might be easiest to do by running instanceSync first, then diff the mod
folders, otherwise, may just have to do it manually.
